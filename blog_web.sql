(1, 'What is COVID-19?', '<h3>What is coronavirus?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. They are called &ldquo;corona&rdquo; because of crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new strain of coronavirus &mdash; COVID-19 &mdash; was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The virus has since spread to all continents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How many people are infected with COVID-19?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of people infected changes daily. As of this writing (10/11/2021), more than 196,910,000 people in the world have been infected. Over 4,850,000 people have died. Some 192 countries and territories on all continents have now reported cases of COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do you get infected with COVID-19?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>COVID-19 enters your body through your mouth, nose or eyes (directly from the airborne droplets or from transfer of the virus from your hands to your face). The virus travels to the back of your nasal passages and mucous membrane in the back of your throat. It attaches to cells there, begins to multiply and moves into lung tissue. From there, the virus can spread to other body tissues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does the new coronavirus (COVID-19) spread from person to person?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COVID-19 is likely spread:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The virus travels in respiratory droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you (within 6 feet). You may be infected if you inhale these droplets.</li>\r\n	<li>You can also get COVID-19 from close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person and then touching your face.</li>\r\n	<li>It&rsquo;s considered possible to get COVID-19 after touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose before washing your hands. But it&rsquo;s thought to be unlikely.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where do coronaviruses come from?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Coronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels. The viruses live in but do not infect the animals. Sometimes these viruses then spread to different animal species. The viruses may change (mutate) as they transfer to other species. Eventually, the virus can jump from animal species and begins to infect humans. In the case of COVID-19, the first people infected in Wuhan, China are thought to have contracted the virus at a food market that sold meat, fish and live animals. Although researchers don&rsquo;t know exactly how people were infected, they already have evidence that the virus can be spread directly from person to person through close contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What&rsquo;s different about the delta variant of COVID-19?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s normal for viruses to mutate &mdash; especially coronaviruses and influenza viruses. These mutations create new variants of the virus. Sometimes the variants are less contagious, less severe or have slightly different presenting symptoms. Unfortunately, the delta variant of COVID-19 (a strain called B.1.617.2) is more highly contagious and more likely to result in severe illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How long is a person infected with COVID-19 considered contagious?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re infected with COVID-19 it can take several days to develop symptoms &mdash; but you are contagious during this time. You are no longer contagious 10 days after your symptoms began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others is to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Stay 6 feet away from others whenever possible.</li>\r\n	<li>Wear a cloth mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others.</li>\r\n	<li>Wash your hands often. If soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid crowded indoor spaces. Bring in outdoor air as much as possible.</li>\r\n	<li>Stay self-isolated at home if you are feeling ill with symptoms that could be COVID-19 or have a positive test for COVID-19.</li>\r\n	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>How soon after becoming infected with COVID-19 will I develop symptoms?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The time between becoming infected and showing symptoms (incubation period) can range from 2 to 14 days. The average time before experiencing symptoms is five days. Symptoms can range in severity from very mild to severe. In about 80% of patients, COVID-19 causes only mild symptoms, although this may change as variants emerge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who&rsquo;s most at risk for getting COVID-19?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Persons at greatest risk of contracting COVID-19 are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>People who live in or have recently traveled to any area with ongoing active spread.</li>\r\n	<li>People who have had close contact with a person who has a laboratory-confirmed or a suspected case of the COVID-19 virus. Close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of an infected person for a&nbsp;<em>cumulative</em>&nbsp;total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.</li>\r\n	<li>People over age 60 who have pre-existing medical conditions or a weakened immune system.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Have certain ethnic groups been harder hit by COVID-19?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. Many researchers have analyzed data across the country and in some large cities, looking at number of confirmed cases and deaths based on race and ethnicity and related factors. They found that African Americans and the Latino-Hispanic populations have disproportionately higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers suspect this might be because these ethnic groups tend to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Live in more crowded housing situations &mdash; living in densely populated areas and in multi-generational households &mdash; making social distancing practices difficult.</li>\r\n	<li>Work in consumer-facing service industries and are more likely to use public transportation to get to work, putting them at risk for increased exposure to COVID-19.</li>\r\n	<li>Be at increased risk of severe illness if they get COVID-19 because of higher rates of existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and heart, liver and kidney diseases.</li>\r\n	<li>Be more likely to be uninsured or lack a consistent care source, which limits access to COVID-19 testing and treatment services.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers are still studying other factors that may make ethnic groups more susceptible to negative COVID-19 outcomes, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Genetics.</li>\r\n	<li>Possible differences in lung tissue.</li>\r\n	<li>Socioeconomic status.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 'covid.jpeg', 4, 1, '2022-01-26 18:16:58'),

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

(9, 'What is A Life style? Detail Notes', '<h1>What Is A LIFESTYLE?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>LIFESTYLE is a concept that has taken root over the centuries. This French word, which means &ldquo;life style&rdquo;, came from the early writings of French physician and psychologist, Hugo Grosholz. The word was translated into English in the year 1812, by Rev. Henry Camping. In his work LIFESTYLE was used to refer to the &ldquo;ethical code or moral teachings of a people, their civilization, institutions or communities&rdquo;. The word was again adopted by American psychiatrist and writer, Dr. psychiatry, William Hickham, in the late nineteenth century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to LIFESTYLE, one of the primary keys to living a healthy life style is to change certain things like your diet, your attitude, your behavior, and your habits. These are said to affect your health in a number of ways, such as through excess weight gain, decreased energy levels, chronic diseases, and psychological disorders. LIFESTYLE can also help you lose weight, among other things. The book itself talks about a series of exercises and suggestions to modify one&rsquo;s daily lifestyle. Among other things, it talks about the importance of having a positive mental attitude and of being sociable and sharing feelings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIFESTYLE provides an interesting contrast on healthy living and unhealthy living. As it so happens, it is also an effective tool for those who want to make healthy changes in their lifestyles. As campers, hikers, campers, backpackers and wildlife photographers know, it is not always easy to stay motivated when faced with days of hard hiking and backpacking. Stress management, a key element of a healthy lifestyle, needs to be practiced daily and exercised even under the most trying conditions. The need for this kind of skill and discipline is highlighted by the many studies and reports that have been done on stress related health problems and the challenges faced by campers, walkers and travelers who are constantly on the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIFESTYLE breaks down the way we think about lifestyles and how people view and deal with them. It points out that a healthy lifestyle is a combination of healthy eating and active entertainment and socializing. Being outdoors and interacting with nature is an important part of a good life. But being too much outdoors and interacting with nature can lead to poor physical health, poor mental health and unhealthy lifestyles. LIFESTYLE addresses these kinds of challenges and shows how by making small lifestyle adjustments, you can live a better, more healthy lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Camping, hiking, backpacking and other outdoor adventures are a part of life. But there are some aspects of these activities that can lead to serious health problems if not planned, controlled and enjoyed. The elements of a healthy lifestyle include a balance between active recreation and a healthy diet. Having a solo lifestyle is not an option, as it involves too much responsibility. It is not possible to live a healthy lifestyle without any form of group activity. LIFESTYLE addresses this issue by introducing the idea of a LIFESTYLE travel guide that highlights five critical aspects of a healthy lifestyle and how to combine these aspects into one complete adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to understand that people need a variety of social activities and experiences in order to be happy and healthy. LIFESTYLE encourages young solo travellers to mix with others in an adventurous and balanced life. It introduces young adults to the essential elements of healthy living that they will need to integrate into their routine when they are away from home and in unfamiliar surroundings. A LIFESTYLE travel guide offers practical tips and information about everything you need to know about the best ways to lead a healthy lifestyle from the moment you step off your plane until you reach your destination.

(11, '5G and National Security', '<p>G technologies are portrayed as the new Holy Grail of wireless services: a new breed of digital applications that will exploit its higher speed (200 times faster than 4G) and faster data transfer from wireless broadband networks (i.e. transfers taking 10 times less time than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/publications/going-digital-shaping-policies-improving-lives-9789264312012-en.htm\">4G)</a>. These features will enable services for driverless cars, advanced factory automation, smart cities, e-health and many more. But 5G is not just a promising technology development, it is also a perfect stage for the newest geopolitical drama: a tech war between China and the US, which reminds us of the dangers when a rising power challenges a ruling power &ndash; Sparta vs Athens in ancient Greece, Germany vs Britain a century ago, or US vs Russia during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceps.eu/europe-and-the-digital-arms-race/\">Cold War.</a>&nbsp;And this struggle is only just starting: beside 5G, artificial intelligence and smart cities will all offer new arenas for rivalry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the battle is all about security. 5G networks pose&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eurasiagroup.net/siteFiles/Media/files/1811-14%205G%20special%20report%20public(1).pdf\">unique challenges</a>&nbsp;in this respect. First, the primary functions of 5G networks, as well as the promise behind their economic viability, are performed through software rather than hardware. This is both a significant advantage over legacy wireless networks and a source of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceps.eu/ceps-publications/software-vulnerability-disclosure-europe-technology-policies-and-legal-challenges\">vulnerability</a>, since software is more easily subject to potentially malicious attacks exploiting weaknesses. Moreover, today&rsquo;s IT systems are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stiftung-nv.de/sites/default/files/5g_vs._national_security.pdf\">extremely complex</a>: the Systems on a Chip of current smartphones have more than 8 billion transistors and current operating systems have more than 50 million lines of code. Many of these systems are built from parts supplied by many hardware and software vendors: in principle, this creates multiple possible &ldquo;entry points&rdquo; for both malicious attacks and data leaks, through &lsquo;backdoors&rsquo;, hidden remote accesses that can be exploited to gain full control of a device. If one cannot detect and monitor backdoors, the level of safety and security of a 5G network is inevitably compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are ways around these problems, of course. But security assessments, code reviews and penetration tests, while certainly helping to improve overall software quality, cannot prove the absence of malicious code or backdoors. This is true for any manufacturer, not just the Chinese ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s more. 5G network architecture will blur the distinction between the radio access networks (base stations and antennas) and the &lsquo;core&rsquo; network, including switching and transport. This also mirrors a shift of the network&rsquo;s intelligence to the edges rather than at the core, which in turn can have significant implications for network security. The more intelligence is distributed at the edges and the number of connected devices and objects skyrockets, the bigger the attack surface becomes. The tremendous increase in traffic flow will make the detection of malicious traffic that much more difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against this background, the concerns of governments regarding the nature and the quality of the suppliers of 5G equipment are understandable. Indeed, since complete trust in the devices is impossible, trust has to be placed on manufacturers. But this depends on the jurisdiction, the legal systems and the rule of law in which the manufacturer operates. A summary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vlada.cz/assets/media-centrum/aktualne/PRG_proposals_SP_1.pdf\">report</a>&nbsp;of a recent major 5G Security Conference mentions that &ldquo;risk assessments of 5G products should take into account all relevant factors, including the applicable legal environment and other aspects of the supplier&rsquo;s ecosystem&rdquo;. Therefore, the question for the government becomes how to ensure deployment of highly resilient and trustworthy 5G infrastructures on which the country&rsquo;s future economy and society can be built and rely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Differences in the approach to 5G security have emerged between the US and Europe. The US administration decided to blacklist Huawei technologies on national security grounds, and more recently banned American firms from selling components and software to Huawei without prior government approval. The US is also pressuring other countries to ban Huawei on security concerns. What US administration is mostly concerned about is a 2017 Chinese Intelligence Law that allows the government to compel companies such as Huawei to switch off the phones of customers, or use their infrastructure to provide the government with an intelligence advantage. Huawei&rsquo;s top management repeatedly stated that they would rather&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/huawei-would-sooner-shut-down-than-spy-for-china-2019-3?IR=T\">shut down</a>&nbsp;than become a spy for the Chinese government. More recently, they have proposed &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/06/04/729539997/huawei-chairman-willing-to-sign-a-no-spy-deal-with-the-united-states\">no spy agreements&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;with the US, Germany and the UK. Since there is no way to prove the absence of malicious code, network resilience in a case of sabotage may not be attainable: that would only be possible with completely separated networks, excluding commercial applications and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2019/05/23/why-limiting-us-tech-exports-chinese-companies-huawei-risky-strategy\">US analysts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.circleid.com/posts/20190607_google_pushing_trump_administration_for_exemption_of_huawei_ban/\">companies</a>&nbsp;have observed that limiting US tech exports to Chinese companies like Huawei could eventually backfire. The reasoning is as follows: should the ban on Huawei be justified on security grounds, then withholding exports could make things worse. For example, stopping Google from dealing with Huawei will push the Chinese company to create its own version of Android, which may have more bugs than the original Google version. This would in turn increase the risk of Huawei phones being hacked, not least by China. Moreover, while the export ban will weaken Huawei, it will not shut the company down, and may eventually provide China with even stronger incentives to become technologically independent from the US. Finally, limiting the export of US technologies will reduce US output and jobs.<a href=\"https://www.ceps.eu/5g-and-national-security/#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a nutshell, playing hardball with China may not be the best idea for the US on this front. Contrary to the case of 4G, China is clearly in the lead in 5G, and Europe and Korea are also better positioned than the US. A recent report from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/03/2002109302/-1/-1/0/DIB_5G_STUDY_04.03.19.PDF\">Defence Innovation Board</a>&nbsp;of the US Department of Defence clearly stated that &ldquo;As 5G is deployed across the globe in similar bands of spectrum [sub-6 mid-band], China&rsquo;s handset and internet applications and services are likely to become dominant, even if they are excluded from the US. China is on a track to repeat in 5G what happened with the United States in 4G&rdquo;. Based on these warnings, the US would be better off playing its cards in a more conventional setting, such as the WTO and foreign courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the US, Europe is following a different, more cautious path. At the 22 March European Council, national leaders expressed the need for a concerted approach to the security of 5G networks and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/news/common-eu-approach-security-5g-networks-2019-mar-26_en\">European Commission recommended</a>&nbsp;a set of operational steps and measures to ensure a high level of cybersecurity for 5G networks across Europe. The focus is on using existing tools such as certification schemes or even creating new ones. Each member state will be required to carry out a risk assessment to be used at the European level to complete an overall 5G threat landscape and an EU-wide risk assessment. This, by the end of 2019, will lead to the identification and adoption of mitigating measures that will likely include certification requirements, test controls as well as the identification of products and suppliers that are considered potentially non-secure. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/blog-post-security-complexity-and-huawei-protecting-uks-telecoms-networks\">UK National Cyber Security Centr</a>e is leading the way in the mitigation approach, with a mix of measures that go from vendor selection (with the definition of &lsquo;risky vendors&rsquo; &nbsp;&ndash; not just based on country &ndash; and a framework to manage them) to rules such as requiring that every portion of the network have multiple vendors; keeping riskier vendors out of sensitive functions (like the core of the network); designing networks that are tolerant of exploitation of any device (regardless of vendor); and establish continuous monitoring requirements. Therefore, European member states should see the implementation of the 5G networks as an opportunity to create ICT supply chain review processes to assess risks to national security as the UK has started to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe should work to keep competition open among equipment suppliers and capitalise on the historical technical knowledge and capacity of the European suppliers Nokia and Ericsson (founders of the GSMA association and present in ETSI from the beginning), which are facing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-5g/nokia-says-it-has-moved-ahead-of-huawei-in-5g-orders-idUSKCN1T428W\">increasing demand</a>&nbsp;for their equipment in the next generation core network as customers prefer to have dual sourcing for the most sensitive part of the network or just replace existing suppliers.

Huawei&rsquo;s top management repeatedly stated that they would rather&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/huawei-would-sooner-shut-down-than-spy-for-china-2019-3?IR=T\">shut down</a>&nbsp;than become a spy for the Chinese government. More recently, they have proposed &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/06/04/729539997/huawei-chairman-willing-to-sign-a-no-spy-deal-with-the-united-states\">no spy agreements&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;with the US, Germany and the UK. Since there is no way to prove the absence of malicious code, network resilience in a case of sabotage may not be attainable: that would only be possible with completely separated networks, excluding commercial applications and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2019/05/23/why-limiting-us-tech-exports-chinese-companies-huawei-risky-strategy\">US analysts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.circleid.com/posts/20190607_google_pushing_trump_administration_for_exemption_of_huawei_ban/\">companies</a>&nbsp;have observed that limiting US tech exports to Chinese companies like Huawei could eventually backfire. The reasoning is as follows: should the ban on Huawei be justified on security grounds, then withholding exports could make things worse. For example, stopping Google from dealing with Huawei will push the Chinese company to create its own version of Android, which may have more bugs than the original Google version. This would in turn increase the risk of Huawei phones being hacked, not least by China. Moreover, while the export ban will weaken Huawei, it will not shut the company down, and may eventually provide China with even stronger incentives to become technologically independent from the US. Finally, limiting the export of US technologies will reduce US output and jobs.<a href=\"https://www.ceps.eu/5g-and-national-security/#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a nutshell, playing hardball with China may not be the best idea for the US on this front. Contrary to the case of 4G, China is clearly in the lead in 5G, and Europe and Korea are also better positioned than the US. A recent report from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2019/Apr/03/2002109302/-1/-1/0/DIB_5G_STUDY_04.03.19.PDF\">Defence Innovation Board</a>&nbsp;of the US Department of Defence clearly stated that &ldquo;As 5G is deployed across the globe in similar bands of spectrum [sub-6 mid-band], China&rsquo;s handset and internet applications and services are likely to become dominant, even if they are excluded from the US. China is on a track to repeat in 5G what happened with the United States in 4G&rdquo;. Based on these warnings, the US would be better off playing its cards in a more conventional setting, such as the WTO and foreign courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the US, Europe is following a different, more cautious path. At the 22 March European Council, national leaders expressed the need for a concerted approach to the security of 5G networks and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/news/common-eu-approach-security-5g-networks-2019-mar-26_en\">European Commission recommended</a>&nbsp;a set of operational steps and measures to ensure a high level of cybersecurity for 5G networks across Europe. The focus is on using existing tools such as certification schemes or even creating new ones. Each member state will be required to carry out a risk assessment to be used at the European level to complete an overall 5G threat landscape and an EU-wide risk assessment. This, by the end of 2019, will lead to the identification and adoption of mitigating measures that will likely include certification requirements, test controls as well as the identification of products and suppliers that are considered potentially non-secure. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/blog-post-security-complexity-and-huawei-protecting-uks-telecoms-networks\">UK National Cyber Security Centr</a>e is leading the way in the mitigation approach, with a mix of measures that go from vendor selection (with the definition of &lsquo;risky vendors&rsquo; &nbsp;&ndash; not just based on country &ndash; and a framework to manage them) to rules such as requiring that every portion of the network have multiple vendors; keeping riskier vendors out of sensitive functions (like the core of the network); designing networks that are tolerant of exploitation of any device (regardless of vendor); and establish continuous monitoring requirements. Therefore, European member states should see the implementation of the 5G networks as an opportunity to create ICT supply chain review processes to assess risks to national security as the UK has started to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe should work to keep competition open among equipment suppliers and capitalise on the historical technical knowledge and capacity of the European suppliers Nokia and Ericsson (founders of the GSMA association and present in ETSI from the beginning), which are facing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-5g/nokia-says-it-has-moved-ahead-of-huawei-in-5g-orders-idUSKCN1T428W\">increasing demand</a>&nbsp;for their equipment in the next generation core network as customers prefer to have dual sourcing for the most sensitive part of the network or just replace existing suppliers. Furthermore, the EU should contribute to making European industrial policy on digitalisation more robust &ndash; for example by screening foreign direct investment &ndash; and also taking a stronger stand on China&rsquo;s non-market practices such as protectionist industrial policy and for</p>\r\n', '960x0.jpg', 5, 1, '2022-02-05 09:21:51');
